# This is the project for hostapp for web-based miniapps

---

It's a **web-view** for miniapps.

Set the URL to the actual miniapp deployed on AWS S3. It can be done in **app.json**
e.g **https://miniapps.shopboxo.co/gcash/#/ansons-2**

`
{
"url": "http://localhost:4200/",
"pages": [
"pages/index/index"
],
"window": {
"titleBarColor": "#f8f8f8"
}
}

`

## New versions for deals miniapps such as tng-deals-miniapp, gcash-deals-miniapp are also uploaded from here

This project should be opened through Mini Program Studio and new version should be uploaded if needed

Most of the time there's no need to upload new versions since we make changes to the web-miniapps themselves and they'll be already updated
after changes happened.
One of the cases when new version should be uploaded is when the URL for the miniapp changes
